Our Python-based social network analysis tool.
Leveraging graph theory and algorithms, it serves to accomplish our given assignments for the network graph algorithm.

### Key Features:

- **Member Representation:** Utilizes the `Member` class to represent individual members, capturing interactions and follower relationships.
  
- **Social Network Management:** The `SocialNetworkGraph` class manages the network structure, providing functionalities for member addition, relationship establishment, and interaction recording.

- **Engagement Rate Calculation:** Computes engagement rates for each member based on likes, comments, and follower counts.

- **Influence Measurement:** Quantifies the influence of one member on another within the network, facilitating identification of influential individuals.

- **Shortest Path Finding:** Employs Breadth-First Search (BFS) to determine the shortest path between two members, enabling efficient navigation within the network.

- **Highest Engagement Path:** Utilizes Depth-First Search (DFS) to discover the path with the highest engagement between any pair of members, revealing engaging connections.
